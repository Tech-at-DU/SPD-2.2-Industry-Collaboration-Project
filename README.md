You’ll be a wicked wise engineer if know how to implement and analyze the metrics on your products. This is an assignment you will do solo on your own (without working with your team) and submit individually. This term, you’ll PICK ONE of three options to demonstrate your mastery of these concepts:

*Good for people interested in startups, entrepreneurship*
- Install analytics on one of your personal projects or a new landing page
- Do two growth experiments
- Write a short blog post about it

**Option 2: Metrics and Engineering challenges ([ASSIGNMENT HERE](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/201198/assignments/767093/))** <br>
*Good for folks of more engineering-focused students*
- Answer questions on growth case studies
- Complete challenges related to conceptual knowledge
- Advise teammates on data driven decisions

**Option 3: Make School’s web analytics ([ASSIGNMENT HERE](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/201198/assignments/794179/))** <br>

Students are building their product in partnership with an actual organization in industry which will help them develop cross-department collaboration skills. Student teams determine goals for their V2 along with the instructor and industry partner. 
 - **Due Nov 12th**
